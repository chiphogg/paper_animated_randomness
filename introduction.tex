Accurate visualization requires \textit{multiple} draws.
These can be superimposed on a single graph, but this creates tension between
visual clarity (fewer draws) and representative sampling (more draws).
The problem is especially severe for surfaces, where only a handful can be
shown before their mutual occlusion become hopelessly cluttered.

A helpful alternative is to show the draws in succession over time -- in other
words, to create an animation.

  \item Two approaches
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Skilling (1991/2), Hennig (2013): great circles
    \item ESG (1997): Statistically correct interpolation
  \end{itemize}
