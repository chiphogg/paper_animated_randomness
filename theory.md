We want to visualize an \(n\)-dimensional Gaussian distribution, \(N(\mu, \Sigma)\), with mean vector \(\mu \equiv \{\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_n\}\) and covariance matrix \(\Sigma\).
A single draw from \(N(\cdot)\) requires \(n\) draws from the standard 1-dimensional normal distribution \cite{3569} (or, equivalently, a draw from the standard \(n\)-dimensional normal \cite{hennig-tr-is-8}.
