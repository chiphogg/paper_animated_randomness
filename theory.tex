\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

We want to visualize an arbitrary $n$-dimensional Gaussian distribution,
  $N(\mu, \Sigma)$,
with mean vector
  $\mu \equiv \{\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_n\}$
and covariance matrix $\Sigma$.

A single draw from $N(\cdot)$ requires $n$ draws from the standard
1-dimensional normal distribution \cite{3569}
(or, equivalently, a draw from the standard $n$-dimensional normal
\cite{hennig-tr-is-8}), as follows.
Let
  $\epsilon \equiv \{\epsilon_1, \cdots, \epsilon_n\}$
be $n$ i.i.d. Gaussian values.
Let
  $L \equiv \text{Chol}(\Sigma)$
be the (lower-triangular) Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix
$\Sigma$.
Then the vector
  \begin{equation}
    \gamma \equiv \mu + L \epsilon
    \label{eqn:oneRandomDraw}
  \end{equation}
is a single draw from $N(\cdot)$.

The goal of animation is to produce multiple draws, $\gamma(t)$, whose
marginal distribution is always equal to $N(\cdot)$:
  $\gamma(t) \sim N(\mu, \Sigma) \,\, \forall t$.
Thanks to Equation~\ref{eqn:oneRandomDraw}, it is sufficient to construct an
$\epsilon(t)$ which is marginally drawn from the \textit{standard} normal:
  $\epsilon(t) \sim N(0, I) \,\, \forall t$
\cite{hennig-tr-is-8}.

\cite{hennig-tr-is-8} treated $\epsilon$ holistically, and exploited the
spherical symmetry of the distribution.
This paper instead treats the $\{\epsilon_i\}(t)$ as independent copies of
a single type of object: the \textit{standard Gaussian oscillator}.
The present approach yields paths with more variety, and is simpler both in
theory and implementation.

\subsection{Gaussian oscillators}
\label{sub:gaussian_oscillators}

A standard Gaussian oscillator is a set of random variables, $\{X_t\}$,
indexed by the continuous variable $t$, with the following properties:

1. Marginally, $X_t \sim N(0, 1) \forall t$.
2. $\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \langle X_t X_{t + \Delta t} \rangle = 0
   \forall t$

Informally, one can imagine the oscillator as a particle moving back and forth
along the real line as time, $t$, passes.  The expectation of the fraction of
time it spends at each position $x$ is $N(x; 0, 1)$.

Gaussian oscillators have usually been constructed by interpolation.
First, the integer-valued times
evenly-spaced values of $t$.  Then
